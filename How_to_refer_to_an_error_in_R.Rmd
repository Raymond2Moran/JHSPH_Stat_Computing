```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For reporting an error in R, suppose we have an weird error that we want to report to someone:

```{r error}
stop("This R error is weird")
```

Now, copy the line of the code (line 17), then run `reprex::reprex()` in the R console. Then we got:

``` r
stop("This R error is weird")
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): This R error is weird
```

Which could be shared with someone using Git.
